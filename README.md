# Tomoto

Pomodoro timer integrated with different services. Have you ever got distracted when you just started a pomodoro? That's the story of my life. What about preventing the distraction directly? Removing slack notification for example, or any notifications. And what if you could even notify the people instead that you're in the middle of something? It would be even better!

## Run it

```
cargo run
```

## Planning

I'll try to keep everything on one place: https://github.com/juanwolf/tomato/projects

## Contributions

At the minute the project is pretty useless so just give me some time to release something I would be proud of :smile:. I'll accept contributions after the v1.0.0 release.
